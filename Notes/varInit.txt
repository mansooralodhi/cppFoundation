-   The C++ language is a "case sensitive" language. 

-   Note in the panel above that other than char (which has a size of exactly one byte), 
    none of the fundamental types has a standard size specified (but a minimum size, at most)

-   Variable initialization:
    c-like initialization: 
        type identifier = inital_value;
        int x = 0;
    constructor_initialization: 
        type identifier (initial_value);
        int x (0);
    uniform initialization: 
        type identifier {initial_value};
        int x {0};
