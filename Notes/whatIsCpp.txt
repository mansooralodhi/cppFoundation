There are several types of programming that C++ supports:

1. procedureal programming
2. oop
3. generic programming
4. functional programming


Lets talk about theory of generic programming !

- Compiler will create as many different functions as number of different datatype accessing the same function.
- Placeholders can be used to replace any generic data type during compile time.
