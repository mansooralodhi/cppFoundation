# include --> Preprocessor directive

the above preprocessor runs before the compilation process and allows to include the header or library files with built in or predefined 
features or operations.

<iostream> --> Header File: iostream, allows to use some built in commands such as cout, cin, etc. Note this is not extension.

namespace std --> Here all the library feature/functions are place in the name of std.  further details later ...

int main(){} --> starting point of program/file. Note you need not to call the main function itself. 

int x --> a variable, x, is nothing but a name for a memory location.

dataypes --> the reason we define datatypes is to reduce the memory required at compile time. If we don't expect, and we usually don't expect 
            very large/small numbers in programs, than its better to use less memory consumed datatypes such as int. This not only reduces the
            compile time of the program but only the execution time. Note, dataypes are represented by keywords in program. e.g. integer has keyword int. 

keyword --> nothing but a representation of some dataype or functionality. e.g. for, while, int, float, etc.

type modifier --> short int, long int -- the 'short' and 'long' here are called type modifer.
